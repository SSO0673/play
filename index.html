    <h2>About Sharks</h2>
    <p>Sharks exhibit peak activity in <em>diverse global regions</em> influenced by factors like water temperature and prey abundance. 
    The Coral Triangle, spanning Southeast Asia and the Pacific, stands out for its rich shark diversity. Coastal areas of South Africa,
    Australia, and the Galápagos Islands are hubs for shark activity, boasting vibrant marine ecosystems. Migration routes in the Atlantic 
    and Pacific Oceans witness heightened shark presence during specific seasons. From the iconic <strong>Great White sharks</strong> off South Africa to the hammerheads in the Galápagos,
    these apex predators strategically navigate the world's oceans, converging in areas that offer optimal conditions for feeding, breeding, and overall survival.</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Cartilaginous Skeleton: Unlike most fish that have bony skeletons, 
          sharks have a cartilaginous skeleton, which is lighter and more flexible. This feature contributes to their agility in the water.</li>
      <li>Streamlined Body: Sharks typically have a streamlined body shape, helping them move efficiently through the water. 
          This hydrodynamic design reduces drag and allows for quick and precise movements.</li>
      <li>Dermal Denticles: The skin of sharks is covered in tiny, tooth-like structures called dermal denticles. 
          These structures help reduce drag and provide protection, making the skin rough to the touch.</li>
      <li>Multiple Rows of Teeth: Sharks are known for their impressive dental structures. They have multiple rows of teeth, and as front teeth wear down or fall out, new teeth from the rows behind them continually replace them. 
          This adaptability ensures that sharks always have sharp teeth for catching and eating prey.</li>
      <li>Powerful Jaws: Sharks have powerful jaws that are well adapted for biting and tearing prey. The structure of their jaws allows them to deliver a strong bite force.</li>
      <li>Excellent Sense of Smell: Sharks possess an exceptional sense of smell. Their olfactory organs are highly developed, helping them detect prey from long distances, even in low concentrations.</li>
      <li>Ampullae of Lorenzini: Sharks have specialized electroreceptor organs called ampullae of Lorenzini. These organs allow them to detect weak electric fields produced by living organisms, aiding in locating prey.</li>
      <li>Heterocercal Tail: The tail fin of sharks is typically heterocercal, meaning that the upper lobe is larger than the lower lobe. This design provides lift, stability, and helps sharks maintain buoyancy.</li>
      <li>Lateral Line System: Sharks have a lateral line system, a series of sensory organs along their sides. This system enables them to detect vibrations and pressure changes in the water, helping them navigate and locate prey.</li>
      <li>redatory Behavior: Most sharks are carnivorous predators, playing a crucial role in marine ecosystems by controlling prey populations and maintaining a balance in the food chain.</li>
