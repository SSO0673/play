    <h2>About Sharks</h2>
    <p>Sharks exhibit peak activity in <em>diverse global regions</em> influenced by factors like water temperature and prey abundance. 
    The Coral Triangle, spanning Southeast Asia and the Pacific, stands out for its rich shark diversity. Coastal areas of South Africa,
    Australia, and the Galápagos Islands are hubs for shark activity, boasting vibrant marine ecosystems. Migration routes in the Atlantic 
    and Pacific Oceans witness heightened shark presence during specific seasons. From the iconic <strong>Great White sharks</strong> off South Africa to the hammerheads in the Galápagos,
    these apex predators strategically navigate the world's oceans, converging in areas that offer optimal conditions for feeding, breeding, and overall survival.</p>
